# pulsar-pseudo-cluster
One script to (re)deploy Pulsar in pseudo-cluster mode.

- Introduction video: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1rU4y1d7c7

## User case

1. Rapid deployment a cluster, which is more complex than standalone but simpler than production.
2. Quick install for take a experience with new releases and new features (perhaps your old environment is gone).
3. Require frequent testing (compatibility testing, etc.).

## Features

1. One click deployment (one script. `./deploy.sh` ).
2. Script can be executed repeatedly to deploy a new clusters.
3. Contains the simplest configuration and administration commands that might be useful for beginners.

## How to use

```shell
# Clone this repo
$ git clone https://github.com/futeng/pulsar-pseudo-cluster.git 
$ cd pulsar-pseudo-cluster/

# Put your apache-pulsar tarball in the `pulsar-pseudo-cluster` directory (keep in same directory)
# for example download from CDN (take version of 2.9.1)
$ wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/pulsar/pulsar-2.9.1/apache-pulsar-2.9.1-bin.tar.gz --no-check-certificate

# Just execute the deployment script
$ sh deploy.sh
```

Tips: It's recommend to stop all threads ( `./stop-all.sh` ) before you redeploy (double check).
